# Build VMware Event Router from Source

Requirements: This project uses [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/) and Go [modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules){:target="_blank"}. For convenience a Makefile and Dockerfile are provided requiring `make` and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/){:target="_blank"} to be installed as well.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vmware-samples/vcenter-event-broker-appliance
cd vcenter-event-broker-appliance/vmware-event-router

# for Go versions before v1.13
export GO111MODULE=on

# defaults to build with Docker (use make binary for local executable instead)
make
```

> **Note:** For `_test.go` files your editor (e.g. vscode) might show errors and
> not be able to resolve symbols. This is due to the use of build tags which
> `gopls` currently does [not
> support](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/29202#issuecomment-515170916). In
> vscode add this to your configuration:
>
> ```json
> "go.toolsEnvVars": {
>        "GOFLAGS": "-tags=integration,unit"
> }
> ```

## Contribute

If you would like to make modification/additions to this code base, please
follow our [CONTRIBUTION](https://vmweventbroker.io/community) guidelines first.

In the `Makefile` we provide `make` targets for building a binary, Docker image
and validating changes via unit tests (`make unit-test`). These tests will run
when a pull request is submitted, but in order to run them locally to verify
your changes you need to have the following bits installed:

`make unit-test`:

- `go` tool chain
- `make`
- `gofmt`

To run the integration tests without the need to create the testbed manually use
the following script:

`./hack/run_integration_tests.sh`:

- `go` tool chain
- `jq`
- `kind`
- `docker`

# VMware Event Router

The VMware Event Router is used to connect to various VMware event `streams` (i.e. "sources") and forward these events to different `processors` (i.e. "sinks"). This project is currently used by the [*VMware Event Broker Appliance*](https://github.com/vmware-samples/vcenter-event-broker-appliance){:target="_blank"} as the core logic to forward vCenter events to configurable event `processors` (see below).

**Supported event providers:**

- [VMware vCenter Server](https://www.vmware.com/products/vcenter-server.html)
- vCenter Simulator [vcsim](https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/master/vcsim) (for
  testing purposes only)

**Supported event processors:**

- [Knative](https://knative.dev/)
- [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/)
- [AWS EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/?nc1=h_ls)

The VMware Event Router uses the [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/) standard
to normalize events from the supported event `providers`. See
[below](#example-event-structure) for an example.

**Event Delivery Guarantees:**

- At-least-once event delivery
  - with the [vCenter event provider](#provider-type-vcenter) option `checkpoint: true`
- At-most-once event delivery
  - with the [vCenter event provider](#provider-type-vcenter) option `checkpoint: false`
  - with the [vcsim event provider](#provider-type-vcsim)

**Current limitations:**

- Only one event `provider` and one event `processor` can be configured at a
  time (see note below)
- At-least-once event delivery semantics are not guaranteed if the event
  router crashes **within seconds** right after startup and having received *n* events but before creating the
  first valid checkpoint (current checkpoint interval is 5s)
- If an event cannot be successfully delivered (retried) by an event `processor` it is
  logged and discarded, i.e. there is currently no support for dead letter
  queues (see note below)
- Retries in the [OpenFaaS event processor](#processor-type-openfaas) are only
  supported when running in synchronous mode, i.e. `async: false` (see this
  OpenFaaS [issue](https://github.com/openfaas/nats-queue-worker/issues/84))

> **Note:** It is possible though to run **multiple instances** of the event
> router with different configurations to address multi-vCenter scenarios

> **Note:** Event Processors, like Knative, support Dead Letter Queues when
> using `Broker` mode.

## Configuration

The VMware Event Router can be run standalone (statically linked binary) or
deployed as a Docker container, e.g. in a Kubernetes environment. See
[deployment](#deployment) for further instructions. The configuration of event
`providers` and `processors` and other internal components (such as metrics) is
done via a YAML file passed in via the `-config` command line flag.

```
 _    ____  ___                            ______                 __     ____              __

Usage of ./vmware-event-router:

  -config string
        path to configuration file (default "/etc/vmware-event-router/config")
  -log-json
        print JSON-formatted logs
  -log-level string
        set log level (debug,info,warn,error) (default "info")

commit: <git_commit_sha>
version: <release_tag>
```

The following sections describe the layout of the configuration file (YAML) and specific options for the supported event `providers`, `processors` and `metrics` endpoint. Configuration examples are provided [here](https://github.com/vmware-samples/vcenter-event-broker-appliance/blob/development/vmware-event-router/deploy){:target="_blank"}.

> **Note:** Currently only one event `provider` and one event `processor` can be configured at a time, e.g. one vCenter Server instance streaming events to OpenFaaS **or** AWS EventBridge. It is possible to run multiple instances of the event router with different configurations to address multi-provider/processor scenarios.

### Overview: Configuration File Structure (YAML)

The following file, using `vcenter` as the event `provider` and `openfaas` as the `processor` shows an example of the configuration file syntax:

**Example Configuration File:**

```yaml
apiVersion: event-router.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: RouterConfig
metadata:
  name: router-config-openfaas
  labels:
    key: value
eventProvider:
  type: vcenter
  name: veba-demo-vc-01
  vcenter:
    address: https://my-vcenter01.domain.local/sdk
    insecureSSL: false
    checkpoint: true
    auth:
      type: basic_auth
      basicAuth:
        username: administrator@vsphere.local
        password: ReplaceMe
eventProcessor:
  type: knative
  name: veba-demo-knative
  knative:
    encoding: binary
    insecureSSL: false
    destination:
      ref:
        apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
        kind: Broker
        name: rabbit
        namespace: default
metricsProvider:
  type: default
  name: veba-demo-metrics
  default:
    bindAddress: "0.0.0.0:8082"
```

### JSON Schema Validation

In order to simplify the configuration and validation of the YAML configuration
file a JSON schema [file](README.MD) is provided. Many editors/IDEs offer
support for registering a schema file, e.g.
[Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Settings_Languages_JSON_Schema.html)
and [VS
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings).

> **Note:** The schema file can be downloaded and provided via a local file
> location or (recommended) via a direct URL, e.g. Github
> [raw](https://help.data.world/hc/en-us/articles/115006300048-GitHub-how-to-find-the-sharable-download-URL-for-files-on-GitHub)
> URL pointing to the aforementioned JSON schema file.

#### **Provider Type `vcenter`**

VMware vCenter Server is advanced server management software that provides a
centralized platform for controlling your VMware vSphere environments, allowing
you to automate and deliver a virtual infrastructure across the hybrid cloud
with confidence. Since VMware vCenter Server event types are environment specific (vSphere version,
extensions), a list of events for vCenter as an event source can be generated as
described in this [blog post](https://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2019/12/listing-all-events-for-vcenter-server.html).

The following table lists allowed and required fields for connecting to a
vCenter Server and the respective type values and examples for these fields.

| Field           | Type    | Description                                                                                           | Required | Example                          |
| --------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| `address`       | String  | URI of the VMware vCenter Server                                                                      | true     | `https://10.0.0.1:443/sdk`       |
| `insecureSSL`   | Boolean | Skip TSL verification                                                                                 | true     | `true` (i.e. ignore errors)      |
| `checkpoint`    | Boolean | Configure checkpointing via checkpoint file for event recovery/replay purposes                        | true     | `true`                           |
| `checkpointDir` | Boolean | **Optional:** Configure an alternative location for persisting checkpoints (default: `./checkpoints`) | false    | `/var/local/checkpoints`         |
| `<auth>`        | Object  | vCenter credentials                                                                                   | true     | (see `basic_auth` example below) |

#### **Provider Type `vcsim`**

The following table lists allowed and required fields for connecting to the
govmomi vCenter Simulator [vcsim](https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/master/vcsim) and the respective type values and examples for these fields.

| Field         | Type    | Description                           | Required | Example                          |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| `address`     | String  | URI of the govmomi vCenter simulator  | true     | `https://127.0.0.1:8989/sdk`     |
| `insecureSSL` | Boolean | Skip TSL verification                 | true     | `true` (i.e. ignore errors)      |
| `<auth>`      | Object  | govmomi vCenter simulator credentials | true     | (see `basic_auth` example below) |

> **Note:** This event provider has some limitations and currently does not
> behave like a "real" vCenter Server event stream, e.g. see issue
> [#2134](https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/issues/2134). This provider is for
> prototyping/testing purposes only.

| `<processor_type>` | Object | Processor specific configuration        | true     | (see specific processor type section below) |

#### **Processor Type `knative`**

Knative is a Kubernetes-based platform to deploy and manage modern serverless
workloads. Knative has two core building blocks, that is Serving (Knative
`Service`) and Eventing (`Broker`, `Channel`, etc.). 

The VMware Event Router can be configured to directly send events to any
*addressable* Knative resource ("reference"), e.g. a Knative `Broker` or
`Service`. `Broker` is the recommended deployment model for the VMware Event
Router. Please see the Knative documentation on
[Eventing](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/) for details around brokers,
triggers, event filtering, etc.

Alternatively, the router can send events to a URI, e.g. an external HTTP endpoint accepting
CloudEvents.

The following table lists allowed and optional fields for using Knative as an
event `processor`.

| Field           | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                | Required | Example                           |
| --------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| `<destination>` | Object  | Knative *addressable* Destination to send events to.                                                                                                       | true     | (see `destination` section below) |
| `encoding`      | Boolean | Cloud Events message [encoding](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md#message)                                                             | true     | `structured` or `binary`          |
| `insecureSSL`   | Boolean | Skip TSL verification                                                                                                                                      | true     | `true` (i.e. ignore errors)       |
| `<auth>`        | Object  | **Optional:** authentication data (see auth section below). Omit section if your Knative Service, URI (Ingress) or Broker does not enforce authentication. | false    | (see `basic_auth` example below)  |

> **Note:** When sending events to a Knative `Broker`, the Knative broker will always
> send `binary` encoded cloud events to the Knative sinks, e.g. triggered `Service`.

##### **Destination**

Knative abstracts event receivers ("sinks") in a very flexible way via
*addressable* `Destinations`. The VMware Event Router technically supports all
Knative `Destinations`. However, Knative `Broker` or Knative `Services` are
likely the ones you will be using.

> **Note:** We have not done any testing for Knative `Channels`, since
> request response style interactions are out of scope for the VMware Event
> Router.

The following table lists the available destination types for the `destination` section in
the router configuration when targeting a URI.

| Field        | Type   | Description                                                    | Required              | Example                       |

| `uri.host`   | String | URI target host                                                | `true`                | `gateway-external.corp.local` |

The following table lists the available destination types for the `destination` section in
the router configuration when targeting a URI.

| Field            | Type   | Description                                                                           | Required              | Example                                               |

> **Note:** Only one of `uri` or `ref` MUST be specified. The list of all
> available URI options is documented [here](https://pkg.go.dev/net/url#URL).

> **Note:** A vanilla Kubernetes `Service` can also be specified when using
> `Ref` as the destination type. Use `v1` in the `apiVersion` section.

#### **Processor Type `openfaas`**

OpenFaaS functions can subscribe to the event stream via function `"topic"`
annotations in the function stack configuration (see OpenFaaS documentation for
details on authoring functions), e.g.:

```yaml
annotations:
  topic: "VmPoweredOnEvent,VmPoweredOffEvent"
```

The following table lists allowed and optional fields for using OpenFaaS as an
event `processor`.

| Field     | Type    | Description                                                                                                       | Required | Example                                          |
| --------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `address` | String  | URI of the OpenFaaS gateway                                                                                       | true     | `http://gateway.openfaas:8080`                   |
| `async`   | Boolean | Specify how to invoke functions (synchronously or asynchronously)                                                 | true     | `false` (i.e. use sync function invocation mode) |
| `<auth>`  | Object  | **Optional:** authentication data (see auth section below). Omit section if OpenFaaS gateway auth is not enabled. | false    | (see `basic_auth` example below)                 |

#### **Processor Type `aws_event_bridge`**

Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus that makes it easy to connect
applications together using data from your own applications, integrated
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services. In order to reduce
bandwidth and costs (number of events ingested, see
[pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/pricing/)), VMware Event Router
only forwards events configured in the associated `rule` of an event bus. Rules
in AWS EventBridge use pattern matching
([docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/filtering-examples-structure.html)).
Upon start, VMware Event Router contacts EventBridge (using the given IAM role)
to parse and extract event categories from the configured rule ARN (see
configuration option below).

The VMware Event Router uses the `"subject"` field in the event payload to store
the event category, e.g. `"VmPoweredOnEvent"`. Thus it is required that you use
a **specific pattern match** (`"detail->subject"`) that the VMware Event Router
can parse to retrieve the desired event (forwarding) categories. For example,
the following AWS EventBridge event pattern rule matches power on/off events
(including DRS-enabled clusters):

```json
{
  "detail": {
    "subject": ["VmPoweredOnEvent", "VmPoweredOffEvent", "DrsVmPoweredOnEvent"]
  }
}
```

`"subject"` can contain one or more event categories. Wildcards (`"*"`) are not
supported. If one wants to modify the event pattern match rule **after**
deploying the VMware Event Router, its internal rules cache is periodically
synchronized with AWS EventBridge at a fixed interval of 5 minutes.

> **Note:** A list of event names (categories) and how to retrieve them can be
> found
> [here](https://github.com/lamw/vcenter-event-mapping/blob/master/vsphere-6.7-update-3.md).

The following table lists allowed and optional fields for using AWS EventBridge
as an event `processor`.

| Field      | Type   | Description                                                                                                                             | Required | Example                                                                |
| ---------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `region`   | String | AWS region to use, see [regions doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html). | true     | `us-west-1`                                                            |
| `eventBus` | String | Name of the event bus to use                                                                                                            | true     | `default` or `arn:aws:events:us-west-1:1234567890:event-bus/customBus` |
| `ruleARN`  | String | Rule ARN to use for event pattern matching                                                                                              | true     | `arn:aws:events:us-west-1:1234567890:rule/vmware-event-router`         |
| `<auth>`   | Object | AWS IAM role credentials                                                                                                                | true     | (see `aws_access_key` example below)                                   |

### The `auth` section

The following table lists allowed and required fields with their respective type
values and examples for these fields. Since the various `processors` and
`providers` use different authentication mechanisms (or none at all) this
section describes the various options.

#### **Type `basic_auth`**

Supported providers/processors:

- `vcenter` (required: `true`)
- `vcsim` (required: `true`)
- `openfaas` (required: `false`, i.e. optional)
- `default` metrics server (see below) (required: `false`, i.e. optional)

| Field                | Type   | Description                             | Required | Example      |
| -------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| `type`               | String | Authentication method to use            | true     | `basic_auth` |
| `basicAuth`          | Object | Use when `basic_auth` type is specified | true     |              |
| `basicAuth.username` | String | Username                                | true     | `admin`      |
| `basicAuth.password` | String | Password                                | true     | `P@ssw0rd`   |

#### **Type `aws_access_key`**

Supported providers/processors:

- `aws_event_bridge`

| Field                        | Type   | Description                                 | Required | Example          |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| `type`                       | String | Authentication method to use                | true     | `aws_access_key` |
| `awsAccessKeyAuth`           | Object | Use when `aws_access_key` type is specified | true     |                  |
| `awsAccessKeyAuth.accessKey` | String | Access Key ID for the IAM role used         | true     | `ABCDEFGHIJK`    |
| `awsAccessKeyAuth.secretKey` | String | Secret Access Key for the IAM role used     | true     | `ZYXWVUTSRQPO`   |

> **Note:** Currently only IAM user accounts with access key/secret are
> supported to authenticate against AWS EventBridge. Please follow the [user
> guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/getting-set-up-eventbridge.html)
> before deploying the event router. Further information can also be found in
> the
> [authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control-eventbridge.html#authentication-eventbridge)
> section.

In addition to the recommendation in the AWS EventBridge user guide you might
want to lock down the IAM role for the VMware Event Router and scope it to these
permissions ("Action"):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "events:PutEvents",
        "events:ListRules",
        "events:TestEventPattern"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### The `metricsProvider` section

The VMware Event Router currently only exposes a default ("internal" or "embedded") metrics
endpoint. In the future, support for more providers is planned, e.g. Wavefront,
Prometheus, etc.

| Field             | Type   | Description                     | Required | Example                                 |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `type`            | String | Type of the metrics provider    | true     | `default`                               |
| `name`            | String | Name of the metrics provider    | true     | `metrics-server-veba`                   |
| `<provider_type>` | Object | Provider specific configuration | true     | See metrics provider type section below |

#### **Provider Type `default`**

The VMware Event Router exposes metrics in JSON format on a configurable HTTP
listener, e.g. `http://<bindAddress>/stats`. The following table lists allowed
and optional fields for configuring the `default` metrics server.

| Field         | Type   | Description                                                                                 | Required | Example                    |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
| `bindAddress` | String | TCP/IP socket and port to listen on (**do not** add any URI scheme or slashes)              | true     | `"0.0.0.0:8082"`           |
| `<auth>`      | Object | **Optional:** authentication data (see auth section). Omit section if auth is not required. | false    | (see `basic_auth` example) |

## Deployment

VMware Event Router can be deployed and run as standalone binary (see
[below](#build-from-source)). However, it is designed (and recommended) to be
run in a Kubernetes cluster for increased availability and ease of scaling out.
The following steps describe the deployment of the VMware Event Router in **a
Kubernetes cluster** for an **existing** OpenFaaS ("faas-netes") environment.

> **Note:** Docker images are available
> [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/vmware/veba-event-router).

### Assisted Deployment

For your convenience we provide a Helm Chart which can be used to easily install
the VMware Event Router into an **existing** OpenFaaS ("faas-netes")
environment. See [below](#openfaas-helm-deployment) for an example how to set up OpenFaaS in
a development environment.

> **Note:** Currently we do not support other event processors for Helm-based deployments.

#### **Helm Deployment**

The Helm files are located in the [chart](chart/) directory. The `values.yaml`
file contains the allowed parameters and parameter descriptions which map to the
VMware Event Router [configuration](#overview-configuration-file-structure-yaml)
file.

##### OpenFaaS Helm Deployment (skip if already installed)

The following steps can be used to quickly install OpenFaaS as a requirement for the
Helm installation instructions of the VMware Event Router below:

```bash
kubectl create ns openfaas && kubectl create ns openfaas-fn

helm repo add openfaas https://openfaas.github.io/faas-netes && \
    helm repo update \
    && helm upgrade openfaas --install openfaas/openfaas \
        --namespace openfaas \
        --set functionNamespace=openfaas-fn \
        --set generateBasicAuth=true

OF_PASS=$(echo $(kubectl -n openfaas get secret basic-auth -o jsonpath="{.data.basic-auth-password}" | base64 --decode))
```

##### Example: Deploy VMware Event Router into a new namespace

First create an `override.yaml` file with your environment specific settings,
e.g.:

```yaml
eventrouter:
  config:
    logLevel: debug
  vcenter:
    address: https://10.186.34.28
    username: administrator@vsphere.local
    password: <vc_account_password>
    insecure: true # ignore TLS certs
  openfaas:
    address: http://gateway.openfaas:8080
    basicAuth: true
    username: admin
    password: <paste_OF_PASS_from_above>

```

> **Note:** Please ensure the correct formatting/indentation which follows the
> Helm `values.yaml` file.


Now add the VMware Event Router Helm release to your Helm repository:

```bash
# adds the veba chartrepo to the list of local registries with the repo name "veba"
helm repo add vmware-veba https://projects.registry.vmware.com/chartrepo/veba
```

To ensure new releases are pulled/updated and reflected locally update the repo index:

```bash
helm repo update
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "vmware-veba" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈ Happy Helming!⎈

```

The chart should now show up in the search:

```bash
helm search repo event-router
NAME                      CHART VERSION   APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION
vmware-veba/event-router  v0.5.0          v0.5.0          The VMware Event Router is used to connect to v...
```

> **Note:** To list/install development releases add the `--devel` flag to the Helm CLI.

Now install the chart using a Helm release name of your choice, e.g. `veba`,
using the configuration override file created above. The following command will
create a release from the chart in the namespace `vmware`, which will be
automatically created if it does not exist:

```bash
helm install -n vmware --create-namespace veba vmware-veba/event-router -f override.yaml
NAME: veba
LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Nov  9 16:27:27 2020
NAMESPACE: vmware
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```

Check the logs of the VMware Event Router to validate it is operating correctly:

```bash
kubectl -n vmware logs deploy/router -f
```

If you run into issues, the logs should give you a hint, e.g.:

- configuration file not found -> file naming issue
- connection to vCenter/OpenFaaS cannot be established -> check values,
  credentials (if any) in the configuration file
- deployment/pod will not even come up -> check for resource issues, docker pull
  issues and other potential causes using the standard `kubectl` troubleshooting
  ways

To uninstall the release run:

```bash
helm -n vmware uninstall veba
```

##### Creating/Updating the Chart

Before running the following commands make the appropriate changes to the chart,
e.g. bumping up `version` and/or `appVersion` in `Chart.yaml`.

```bash
cd chart
helm package -d releases .
```

Then upload the created `.tgz` file inside `releases/` to your Helm chart repo.

#### **Manual Deployment**

Create a namespace where the VMware Event Router will be deployed to:

```bash
kubectl create namespace vmware
```

Use one of the configuration files provided [here](deploy/) to configure the
router with **one** VMware vCenter Server `eventProvider` and **one** OpenFaaS
**or** AWS EventBridge `eventProcessor`. Change the values to match your
environment. The following example will use the OpenFaaS config sample.

> **Note:** Before continuing, make sure your environment is up and running,
> including Kubernetes and the configured event `processor`.

After you made your changes to the configuration file, save it as
`"event-router-config.yaml` in your current Git working directory.

> **Note:** If you have changed the port of the metrics server in the
> configuration file (default: 8080) make sure to also change that value in the
> YAML manifest (under the Kubernetes service entry).

Now, from your current Git working directory create a Kubernetes
[secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) with the
configuration file as input:

```bash
kubectl -n vmware create secret generic event-router-config --from-file=event-router-config.yaml
```

> **Note:** You might want to delete the (local) configuration file to not leave
> behind sensitive information on your local machine.

If you have configured `knative` as your event `processor` you must also create
a `ClusterRoleBinding` for the VMware Event Router so it can lookup Knative
`destinations`.

##### Create Knative ClusterRoleBinding (skip if not using Knative)

The following commands creates the `ClusterRoleBinding` assuming the VMware
Event Router will be deployed into the `vmware` namespace using the predefined
service account (deployment manifest). This requires a properly configured
Knative environment with `Serving` and `Eventing` CRDs installed.

```bash
# only for Knative-based deployments
kubectl create clusterrolebinding veba-addressable-resolver --clusterrole=addressable-resolver --serviceaccount=vmware:vmware-event-router
```

**Addressable Resolver Permissions:**

```bash
kubectl describe clusterrole addressable-resolver
Name:                                            addressable-resolver
Labels:                                          eventing.knative.dev/release=v0.18.4

  channels.messaging.knative.dev/finalizers      []                 []              [update]

```

##### Create the VMware Event Router Deployment

Now we can deploy the VMware Event Router:

```bash
kubectl -n vmware create -f deploy/event-router-k8s.yaml
```

Check the logs of the VMware Event Router to validate it started correctly:

```bash
kubectl -n vmware logs deploy/vmware-event-router -f
```

If you run into issues, the logs should give you a hint, e.g.:

- configuration file not found -> file naming issue
- connection to vCenter/OpenFaaS cannot be established -> check values,
  credentials (if any) in the configuration file
- deployment/pod will not even come up -> check for resource issues, docker pull
  issues and other potential causes using the standard `kubectl` troubleshooting
  ways

To delete the deployment and secret simply delete the namespace we created
earlier:

```bash
kubectl delete namespace vmware
```

### CLI Flags

By default the VMware Event Router binary will look for a YAML configuration
file named `/etc/vmware-event-router/config`. The default log level is `info`
and human readable colored console logs will be printed. This behavior can be
overridden via `log-json` to generate JSON logs and `log-level` to change the
log level. Stack traces are only generated in level `error` or higher. 

```
./vmware-event-router -h

 _    ____  ___                            ______                 __     ____              __
| |  / /  |/  /      ______ _________     / ____/   _____  ____  / /_   / __ \____  __  __/ /____  _____
| | / / /|_/ / | /| / / __  / ___/ _ \   / __/ | | / / _ \/ __ \/ __/  / /_/ / __ \/ / / / __/ _ \/ ___/
| |/ / /  / /| |/ |/ / /_/ / /  /  __/  / /___ | |/ /  __/ / / / /_   / _, _/ /_/ / /_/ / /_/  __/ /
|___/_/  /_/ |__/|__/\__,_/_/   \___/  /_____/ |___/\___/_/ /_/\__/  /_/ |_|\____/\__,_/\__/\___/_/

Usage of dist/vmware-event-router:

  -config string
        path to configuration file (default "/etc/vmware-event-router/config")
  -log-json
        print JSON-formatted logs
  -log-level string
        set log level (debug,info,warn,error) (default "info")

```

## Example Event Structure

The following example for a `VmPoweredOnEvent` shows the event structure and
payload. 

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** The event structure depends on the event `processor` being
 used, e.g. Knative supports `structured` (Cloud Events metadata in message body)
 and `binary` (metadata in message headers) encoding modes. We might also change
 the event structure in the future.

**Example Event Structure (structured JSON encoding):**

```json
{
  "id": "08179137-b8e0-4973-b05f-8f212bf5003b",
  "source": "https://10.0.0.1:443/sdk",
  "specversion": "1.0",
