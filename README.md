## Description

The [vCenter Event Broker Appliance Fling](https://flings.vmware.com/vcenter-event-broker-appliance#summary) enables customers to easily create [event-driven automation based on vCenter Server Events](https://octo.vmware.com/vsphere-power-event-driven-automation/). For example, vCenter Event Broker Appliance can drive basic workflows like automatically attaching a vSphere tag when a virtual machine (VM) is created. Even more powerful integrations between datacenter-internal enterprise services and cloud services, for example Slack and Pager Duty, can be created with vCenter Event Broker Appliance out of the box.

vCenter Event Broker Appliance is provided as a Virtual Appliance that can be deployed to any vSphere-based infrastructure, including an on-premises and/or any public cloud environment, running on vSphere such as VMware Cloud on AWS or VMware Cloud on Dell-EMC.

With this appliance, end-users, partners and independent software vendors only have to write minimal business logic without going through a steep learning curve understanding vSphere APIs. As such, we believe this solution not only offers a better user experience in solving existing problems for vSphere operators. More importantly, it will enable new integration use cases and workflows to grow the vSphere ecosystem and community, similar to what AWS has achieved with AWS Lambda.

To learn more about the vCenter Event Broker Appliance, [Michael Gasch](https://github.com/embano1) and [William Lam](https://github.com/lamw/) of VMware recently presented a session at VMworld called ["If This Then That" for vSphere- The Power of Event-Driven Automation](https://videos.vmworld.com/global/2019/videoplayer/29523) (free VMworld account login is required to view).

## Getting Started

Please refer to the getting started guide [here](getting-started.md)

## Architecture

The vCenter Event Broker Appliance follows a highly modular approach, using Kubernetes and containers as an abstraction layer between the base operating system ([Photon OS](https://github.com/vmware/photon)) and the required application services. Currently the following components are used in the appliance:

- Photon OS ([Github](https://github.com/vmware/photon))
- Kubernetes ([Github](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes))
- Contour ([Github](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour))
- OpenFaaS ([Website](https://www.openfaas.com/))
- vCenter Connector ([Github](https://github.com/openfaas-incubator/vcenter-connector/))
